'''
Code a function to be included in the calculations module.
It accepts two integers as parameters. In a single line,
it adds the two integers together and returns the result.
Call the function, passing two integers as arguments.
(The function call would actually be in your main Python
program, not grouped with the function in the module,
but don't worry about that.) Remember that you need a
variable for storing the returned value. Make up the
name of the function and the name of the variable.
When calling the function, assume that the module has
already been imported.

  return a + b
